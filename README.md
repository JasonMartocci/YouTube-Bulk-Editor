Martocci Mayhem YouTube Bulk Editor: Revolutionize Your Channel Management! Hey Mayhem Squad! Jason Martocci here, bringing you the ultimate chaos-busting tool for YouTube creators. Tired of manually tweaking hundreds of videos one by one? Say goodbye to that nightmare with my custom-branded GUI tool for bulk editing YouTube videos – straight from the Martocci Mayhem labs! This Python-powered beast lets you update titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnails, categories, privacy settings, licenses, and more across multiple videos in one go. 
 
Whether you're rebranding your channel, adding fresh calls-to-action, or optimizing for SEO, this editor saves you hours (or days) of tedious work.
 
Key Features & Selling Points: Bulk Updates Made Easy: Select multiple videos and apply changes to titles (append, prepend, or replace), descriptions (append footers, prepend intros, find/replace text, trim sections, or even regex magic for power users).
 
Tag Mastery: Add, replace, or remove tags in bulk to supercharge your discoverability.
Status & Privacy Tweaks: Switch privacy (public, private, unlisted), set licenses, make videos embeddable, toggle public stats, and declare if it's kid-friendly – all at once.
Category & Language Shifts: Re-categorize videos and set default languages for global appeal.
Thumbnail Overhaul: Upload a new thumbnail to refresh your video's look across selections.
Recording Date Edits: Adjust recording dates for better organization or algorithmic boosts.
Preview & Backup Safety: Preview changes before applying, backup your originals, and restore if needed – no regrets!
Quota-Smart Design: Handles YouTube API limits with batching and delays to avoid quota exhaustion.
Open Source Vibes: Hosted on my GitHub (link below) – fork it, star it, contribute, and build your mayhem! Built with love using Google API Client, Tkinter for the sleek GUI, and a dash of Martocci flair.
